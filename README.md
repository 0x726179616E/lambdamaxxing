some exercises and solutions from [sicp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

note: [racket](https://racket-lang.org/) has been the most straightforward way to run the scheme dialect of lisp on the m1 mac.

- racket can be installed on mac via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install racket`
- racket can run scheme programs with the command: `racket -f "example-program.scm"` as long as the scheme program begins with `(require scheme)`
